      <h1>My Interests</h1>
      <h2>By: Yahya Hussein</h2>
      <h3>I Looooove Food</h3>
      <p>I'm not really picky when it comes to foods, although I do like to keep it simple at most times. I enjoy going to familiar restuarants so I can get the same meals. When I do go to a different place to eat, I asks for suggestions from my peers or the waitor/waitress. When I don't feel like figuring out what I want to order after getting the restuarant I usually just look up things on <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google.</a></p>
      <h4> Top 5 Books.</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Autobiography of Malcolm X</li>
        <li>Permanent Record</li>
        <li>The New Jim Crow</li>
        <li>Black Privelage</li>
        <li>Can't Hurt Me</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Another interest of mine is that I like to workout, usually 6 days/week of intense sessions. What sucks is that every time I hit my groove, something always happens. Most recently being the lockdown due to covid. This causes me to have to restart after losing my gains due to months of inactivity.

      <h2>My First Love</h2>
      <h3>Shoes</h3>
      <p>All types of shoes. Basketball, running, chelsea boots, slippers I love them all. Most recently I've gotten into more of dress up shoes such as loafer and boots. I feel that they can be worn with almost everything especially during the fall and winter seasons. Spring and summers not so much. Pictured below is my favorite sneaker of all time the <b><em>Nike Air Jordan 3 Black Cements</em></b></p>
